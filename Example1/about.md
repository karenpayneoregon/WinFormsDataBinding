This project shows conventional data binding with a list set to a BindingSource then the BindingSource becomes the DataSource of a DataGridView. Also, two TextBox controls are bound to two properties. When a value changes in the DataGridView (First or Last name) they are reflected in the TextBox controls and when a value changes in a TextBox the DataGridView is updated.
